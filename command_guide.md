###  Typical Workflows

**When new matches are played:**
1. `/scoring update_stats fetch:true`  
   → Fetches new matches + updates weekly points.

**When testing locally:**
1. `/account register` with your SteamID.  
2. `/team create` and `/team join`.  
3. `/leaderboard show` to confirm updates.

**When prices need refreshing:**
1. `/pricing update`  
   → Updates player prices from latest stats.

---

###  Daily Update Routine (Recommended Automation)

Goal: ensure all registered users have fully updated match + stat data,  
so any new `/account register` users automatically have fresh history.

**Suggested schedule:** every night at **00:05 Europe/London**

**Tasks to run (in order):**
1. **Fetch new matches and update stats**
    - `/scoring update_stats fetch:true`
    - This pulls any new matches for all registered users
    - Updates `PlayerGame`, `PlayerStats` and `WeeklyPoints`.
2. ** Recalculate player prices**
    - `/pricing update`
    - Uses the latest leetify, faceit, and premier data to refresh player prices
    - Keeps the fantasy market current
